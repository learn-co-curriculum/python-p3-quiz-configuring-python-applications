# Import

Why should we avoid using the \* when importing things from a library?&nbsp;

Example:

```console
from os import *
```

## Correct

It pollutes the name space.

## Incorrect

It is the explicit way of importing.

> Using the \* operator when importing is the implicit way of importing. The
> import statement doesn't tell us exactly what we are using from the
> module.&nbsp;
