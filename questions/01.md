# File IO

What will the following code print?

```python
text_file = open('file_directory/file_name.txt')

print(text_file.mode)
```

## Correct

```ruby
r
```

> Correct! The default mode is "read"

## Incorrect

```ruby
w
```

> Since we are not passing the mode argument in the open function the default mode
> will be 'r' for read. If we wanted to open the file in 'write' mode we would
> need to use the following code.&nbsp;
> 
> ```python
> text_file = open('file_directory/file_name.txt', mode='w')
> ```

## Incorrect

```ruby
a
```

> Not quite!&nbsp;
